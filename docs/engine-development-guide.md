## Quick Links

| Topic | Link |
|-------|------|
| **Engine Development Guide** | [engine-development-guide.md](https://github.com/DigiJoe79/audiobook-maker-engines/blob/main/docs/engine-development-guide.md) |
| **Engine Server API** | [engine-server-api.md](https://github.com/DigiJoe79/audiobook-maker-engines/blob/main/docs/engine-server-api.md) |
| **Model Management** | [model-management.md](https://github.com/DigiJoe79/audiobook-maker-engines/blob/main/docs/model-management.md) |
| **Quick Reference** | [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/DigiJoe79/audiobook-maker-engines/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) |

## Why the Move?

The engine development documentation now lives in the [audiobook-maker-engines](https://github.com/DigiJoe79/audiobook-maker-engines) repository because:

1. **Base server classes** (`base_server.py`, `base_tts_server.py`, etc.) are in that repository
2. **Docker engine development** happens in that repository
3. **Engine templates** and examples are maintained there
4. **Single source of truth** - no documentation drift between repos
